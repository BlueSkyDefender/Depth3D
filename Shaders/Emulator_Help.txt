{King's Field: The Ancient City} - You can open SuperDepth3D and enable Legacy Mode on line 64. But, it's somewhat playable with out this.
Due to the speed of the game. You also need to enable Skip Draw from 1-3 To grab the depth buffer. Not 1-1 like it says in the wiki.

{Haunting Ground} - You can open SuperDepth3D and enable Legacy Mode on line 64. But, it's somewhat playable with out this. You also need to set 
Texture Offsets X: 500 and Y: 500 to fix that shader Layer issue. Also Depth Buffer seems to be shallow in some areas of the game I can't fix this.

{Clock Tower 3} - You need to use GSDX 3D Stereo build here. There are some graphics glitches using this. But, It's playable with some eye strain.
Try this in the other games here.

{Metal Gear Solid 2} - Open SuperDepth3D and enable Legacy Mode on line 64. Radar Off is the best IMO SkipDraw 3,3 or 3,4 and set Boundary to Normal.
Radar One & Radar Two set SkipDraw to [4,4] , [4,5] or the values above and set Boundary to Third person. But, don't use Radar One or Two to many issues.

{Metal Gear Solid 3} - Optional too open SuperDepth3D and enable Legacy Mode on line 64. Since bluring seems not too strong. Make sure you follow the
