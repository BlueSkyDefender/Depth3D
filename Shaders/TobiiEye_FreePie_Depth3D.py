#To use this script load it up in FreePie and make sure you have Tobii Eye Tracker fully installed and Enabled.

#Then make sure to start FreePie in Admin mode then run this script. Once that is done Move your head the full
#length of your monitor so that it calibrates it's center. Then start your game with reshade and start my Shader.
#Once in game and in SuperDepth3D's Menu use the Calibrate slider to reduce the ghosting in game to a tolerable
#level. There should be a veary slight delay in tracking this is ok for now maybe it can be improved later.
