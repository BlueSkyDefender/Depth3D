{35MM} - Used ReShade 4.0+
Depth Buffer may hang for a sec if you move your view to fast. Hope ReShade 4.4 fixes this.

{.Hack//G.U.} - Used ReShade 3.0.8
Once you install Reshade. Install this fix that allows for depth buffer access. This fix uses 3DMigoto to disable a shader that was blocking acess to the depth buffer.
http://www.mediafire.com/file/d5ep3qlsnbbbmvl/dotHack%20GU%20fix%20for%20Depth3D.zip

{A Plague Tale: Innocence} - Used ReShade 4.7.0
So we are going to remove some post effects that effect the 3D Image in a negitive way.

Befor everything please launch the game and set your settings and exit the game. Then locate ENGINESETTINGS below.

The Config file is located at.
User\Documents\My Games\A Plague Tale Innocence\

Open the ENGINESETTINGS file with a text editor and look for following options.

DOF
  Enabled 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
MotionBlur
  Enabled 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
PostProcess
  Fringe 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
  LensDistortion 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
  FilmGrain 1 Change the value from 1 to 0

You can also change a few other things like Bloom and Vignette. But, it's up to you.

Save the file. You may want to set to read only.

{Alan Wake} - With Reshade versions up to 4.5.1 you would need the Xenos_2.3.2 Injector. ReShade 4.7.0+ Works with out it.
Install game and before you launch it put -noblur in your set lunch options. -steam
Set you settings in game and notice the locked MSAA.Just leave it at 2x, Save your settings and turn off the game.

I suggest you use alpha mode in SuperDepth3D for this game and Alan Wake's American Nightmare.

You will not need to do this for the sequel. Make sure you turn off this injector for any other game. 
Please note most AV's will detect this as threat.

{Alien Isolation} - Used ReShade 4.7.0
The Shade corrects for the Distortion that the game causes.

This can be dissabled if you use the https://github.com/aliasIsolation/aliasIsolation/releases if you set CA to 0.000
But, If you use this to TAA mod you can't disable motion blur. This is a issue. Anyways dissable the distortion correction at the bottom of the shader.

Motion sickness can happen if you use the TAA mod with motion blur.

Also to remove EyeBall all Lens Flares

Go to the DATA folder of the game.
Delete or rename the LENS_FLARE*.bin files.

or

That removes only the Sun Flare.

{Amnesia: Games} - Used ReShade 4.1.0
Issue with ReShade 4.0.0+ If you install ReShade as opengl32.dll you have to rename it to dxgi.dll in the game folder. Windows 10 Issue it seems.

Also Make sure to disable the insanity post process effect. It messes with the 3D in the game.

{Bard's Tale 4} - Use ReShade 4.7.0
Anoying issue if you read any notice in game you have to set you Depth Adjust ammount form 20 to 200-250 I use 225. If this issue was not there this would had been a
easy game to play. It seems to get stuck like this so not bad bad..... only one time bad. :D

Anyways I advise you set it back to 20 if your going to turn off the game and set it to 200-250 once you encounter a Notice is game. Well please enjoy.

{Battlefield One} - Used ReShade 4.0.2
Added alternet settings mode to my shader. This can be done with the newly added Alternet Depth Buffer Adjust Toggle PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS. This is in Shader.
Ex. FPS mode will be around 7.50. But, For Tank mode you want to use around 20.0.

Please Note:
If you run AMD and have a 2nd GPU in your system like a Nvidia Card. ReShade will Crash this game on start up.

{BattleTech}
Read the section for Dealing with mouse pointer issues. At the top. 

{Batman Arkham Asylum} -Use ReShade 4.4.0+
In older versions of Reshade you may incounter Depth Flickering.

{Batman Arkham Knight} -Use ReShade ???
Depth Buffer seems to drop off in some locations. As reported. This is a ReShade issue not a SuperDepth3D Issue.

{Dementium 2} - Used ReShade 4.4.0
You have to mess with the Depth Buffer options to get it to work. Not perfect. Kind of strange not all reshades work.

{Black Mesa} - Used ReShade 3.2.1 or Use latest with instructions below.
So in newer versions of Reshade 4.4.0+ you need to set in game MSAA on. To do this open the console and enter the command
mat_antialias 2

This should allow reshade to grab the Depth buffer in game. On a side note you should install reshade in to the
SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bin folder.

{BoarderLands 2}
Use a Controller for menus navigation or keyboard. 
Mouse and keyboard is good for gameplay. 
Use Cross_Cursor for navigation with mouse.

{Bioshock Remastred}
In the game settings you would need to dissable Real Time Reflections and use the DLL listed here.

https://reshade.me/forum/releases/3744-3-1?start=200#26443

{Blood: Fresh Suppy}  - Used ReShade 4.5.3
If your going to play this game make sure you do in opengl32 or Vulkan since they offer better depth buffers then DX11.

I would just use Opengl32 for MSAA.

{Blood Crossmatching}
Get it here http://m210.duke4.net/index.php/files/viewdownload/3-eduke32/38-blood-crossmatching

Install Reshade 3.0.4 This is needed to use some lighting & shadows. But, if you don't care for lighting use the newest one.
Install as Direct 3D 10+ so you don't delete opengl32.dll. 
This or install opengl and override opengl32.dll and used a bloom shader from Reshade.
Install to \BloodCM\distr

Once that is done now you can install. High-Resolution Textures Pack for BloodCM game.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bloodcmhrp/

Put xhrp_05fix.zip and zip archives in \BloodCM\autoload folder and check "Enable autoload folder" checkbox in eduke32 setup window. If you don't want to use the textures just disable them in-game that way you can still have the 3D models.

Now the last thing is to start the game and set your settings.

To help fix the depth buffer with lighting & shadows use Console command r_pr_maxlightpasses "1".
This will limit the amount lights processed per surface. Seems to be a hard bug to fix in eduke32.
So I don't think this will get fixed anytime soon.

{Blood 2} - ReShade 4.0.2
You need DGVooDoo2 installed with the following settings and information.
First Start DGVoodoo "2.62.3" Control Panel

Right Click The dgVoodoo Logo and click on, "SHOW ALL SECTIONS OF THE CONFIGURATION."
Now look for Config folder /Running instance click "Add" and guide it to your GOG Games "Blood 2," Folder.

One you are done with that go back to the dgVoodoo Folder and open the MS folder - x86. Copy D3DImm.dll, and DDraw.dll into your GOG Games "Blood 2," Folder. 

Now Install MY "Blood2 Patch for Depth 3D." http://www.mediafire.com/file/3mxvwci29qi0fqp/Blood2PatchDepth3D%2BMods.zip

Click on my included Bat files to start the game.
Depth3D_Blood2_Nightmare_Start.bat
or
Depth3D_Blood2_Start.bat

// May not need this part.
Windows 10 Issues Black Box only audio work around.
You will have to click My Bat file then click again on the black window before the game launches then alt-tab back to the the game.

AMD White Texture work around. Find detailhi.cfg in the Blood 2 folder and set "MipmapOffset" to "1.000000"
You will lose a lot of texture detail. I do not recommend playing like this.

Now For Mods you will have click on the Bat files provided.
//

{BuildGDX}  - Used ReShade 4.7.0 + Xenos to inject.
Download https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases and the latest version of reshade.

Create a folder and extract Xenos 2.3.2 you only really need the Xenos.exe 64 bit program and also extract ReShade 64bit ReShade64.dll in to the same folder
as Xenos. Place SuperDepth3D with Overwatch.fxh in this folder and start Xenos.exe.

Click on Manual Launch radio button.
Click on Add and select the ReShade64.dll.
Click on Select and find the BuildGDX.exe

Now click Inject. Then launch your game like normal.

BloodGDX... Set Depth Offset to 0.990 ot 1.000 you can also increase Seperation 0.005 to 0.105

{Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019} - ReShade 4.4.2 [Some people had some luck with ReShade 4.2.]
First of all please set the game's "Shadow Map Resolution to [Normal <>]." Also Make sure you turn off DOF and Motion Blur.

Next follow this yourtube Video to set ReShade Depth Buffer Settings.
https://youtu.be/JzkgHkXRMCg

You have to reset setting in the depth buffer tab and then set it to D16 and restart your game and follow the strange ritual again. 

Your game may and most likely will crash when you uncheck the 2nd option.

Also no real way to fix the 1frame delay due to issue in this game.

{Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3}
Set Image Quality to Native.
You can also use DGVoodoo 2.6 to make the game DX11 and grab a better depth buffer maybe.

{Call of Duty: Advance Warfare}
Render Resolution Native.
Turn off AA.
Don't use in game Supersampling
FOV Sucks i know.

{Call of Duty: Ghost}
Set Image Quality to Extra.

{Call of Duty: Black Ops 2}
Turn off AA.

{Call of Duty: Black Ops 4}
Game crashes under Nv Hardware.
Use an AMD Card to play this game in 3D.

{Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare}
Render Resolution Native.
Turn off AA.
Don't use in game Supersampling

{Cloud Punk} - Used ReShade 4.9
Once you install Reshade. Install this fix that allows for depth buffer access. This fix uses 3DMigoto to disable a shader that was blocking acess to the depth buffer.
http://www.mediafire.com/file/25qdu9lurxfucg2/Cloudpunk_fix_for_Depth3D.zip

{Condemned Criminal Origins} - Used ReShade 4.4
Issues with Depth it will stop after scripted events try to use the newest option at the bottom of depth buffer compatablity for DX9.
Also Dissable FSAA (FSAA OFF) or was it turn it on I forget.
This is bug in game that drops fps in to the single diglets...... you need a pokemon that strong againts ground types.
I kid I kid I don't know how to fix this issue try pc gaming wiki when fps drops in the the single digits.

{DeadRising 3}
Use Native scailing I think it's called in game as Full.
I also suggest useing the 60FPS and 80FOV Fix for this game.

https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Rising_3

{Deadly Premonition}
Can Run with Higer Rez useing DPfix095.
To Use it with Reshade Just Start Up Reshade and Make a profile for it like any other game.

Then head to the folder and rename d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. 
Now open the DPfix095.zip Directly from http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DPfix095.zip or http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438.

Install the contents of that folder in to Deadly Premonition Folder where you changed Reshade's d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. Edit the DPfix.ini too what ever REZ you want. Then start the game.

{Destroy All Humans!} - ReShade 4.7.0
Game runs fine issues with DoF and/or other effects.

To Disable Depth of Field in DAH!

Head over to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\DH\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
Open the “Engine.ini” file
Add:
[SystemSettings]
r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0
r.MotionBlur.Max=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0

For Bloom Add:
r.BloomQuality=0

Save the file Set it to read only. I recommend you set your setting in games first befor all of this.

Now I also say you should use a FOV mod. You can use this game.

https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1948-destroy-all-humans-fov-changer/

I also recommend you use View Mode set to Alpha. Because of all the Foliage.

{Devil May Cry 5} - ReShade 4.7.0
Some Issues in game since you can't use most, fixes with out running in "DX12." There is not much you can do.

Go to <path-to-game>
Open dmc5config.ini

In here you can change

DepthOfFiledEnable=true 
to 
DepthOfFiledEnable=false

you can also try to set Fov=90

Save your changes. Not sure it works.

{DOOM - 2016}
Issues with AMD hardware. No depth buffer.

If I am wiling to gues it's because it defaults from Opengl 4.6.0 to 4.3.0 under AMD. Guess you should use a Nv Card for this game. If you know of a way to fix this tell me.

{Dragon Ball FightersZ} - Use ReShade 3.1.2
Online 3D works aswell. You need to use ReShade 3.1.2 That is whitelisted under EAC.

{Duke Nukem 3D} - Use ReShade ?.?.?
So getting eduke32 working with Polymer HRP and Duke Nukem 3D.

Prerequisites: Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition or Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour
Right now it's on sale at Humble Store.

A. Folder needed either one or the other. Not Both. :p
Duke Nukem 3D
Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
B. You would also need eduke32 The latest release. www.eduke32.com/
Windows Download
eduke32_latest.7z
Extract, "B 2."
C. Place the contents of eduke32_latest into, "A 1 or A 2."

D. As for the High-Resolution Packs. Get them Here hrp.duke4.net/download.php
Duke3D HRP v5.4 FULL SFX (986 MB) - Self-extracting archive with everything needed to play
Duke3D PSX Highres Sounds v1.11 (7.3 MB)
XXX Pack v1.33 - ;) Why not
E. Extract the ZIP files you need from the packs on top. The files you need should be;
duke3d_hrp.zip
duke3d_music-sc55.zip
duke3d_psx.zip
duke3d_xxx.zip
F. Place "E 1 - 4" into a folder called autoload.

G. Place the autoload folder into, "A 1 or A 2."
Now, go to the autoload folder and extract duke3d_hrp.zip
Open the file go to duke3d_hrp\highres\sprites.def
Now with a basic text editor edit line 5.
Line 5 should look like this. //include highres/sprites/firstperson.def
Save.


H. Now go back and delete "E 1," aka duke3d_hrp.zip

I. Repack the duke3d_hrp folder using zip. I used 7-Zip. Once you have a new duke3d_hrp.zip file you can delete the folder.

J. Install Reshade 3.0.4 This is needed to use some lighting & shadows. But, if you don't care for lighting use the newest one.
ReShade Repository - www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository
Install as OpenGL
Place my 3D shader in the folder, "A 1 or A 2." Aka Duke Nukem 3D / Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
K. Start eduke32.exe in the folder, "A 1 or A 2." Aka Duke Nukem 3D / Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
Check Polymer, Enable "autoload" folder, and fullscreen if you like.
Set Video mode and Input devices
Click Start
L. Once in game press ` and open console.
Use Console Command r_pr_maxlightpasses "1"
M. Now play the game.

Things to note.
The new version of Duke will have problems. forums.duke4.net/topic/8966-wip-world-to...mpatibility-stopgap/
The reason we have to disable the polymer weapon hands. Is that when it's on the screen it removes the rest of the z-Buffer.
The reason we have to use r_pr_maxlightpasses "1" is to correct a problem with the depth buffer when it set to high.
Using r_pr_maxlightpasses "1" will make the game darker. But, it's ok.
Mirrors in the game have problems avoid them.

Other than that my brain thinks that shooting a 3D projectile from a 2D gun is amazing for some reason.

{Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour} - Use ReShade 3.4.1
Game now works with the new DX11_BUFFER_DETECTION. You can set this also in ReShades DX11 Tab in game.
[DX11_BUFFER_DETECTION]
DepthBufferRetrievalMode=1
DepthBufferTextureFormat=2
ExtendedDepthBufferDetection=1
DepthBufferClearingNumber=3

{Dungeon Nightmares II}
Highest Setting is "Good" Any thing Lower will work and thing above will not work. Make sure to set your res to native.

{Dusk/Dusk World} - Reshade 3.4.0
In Reshade you need to set the Depth Buffer D32FS8 and Copy Before Clearing. Select Option 4 for World space. Keep in mind your weapond will not be Drawn in this Depth Buffer.
The weapon Depth Buffer can be found on Option 1. But, can't be merged.....


{Emily Wants To Play}
Install reshade in to SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Emily Wants To Play\Engine\Binaries\Win64

{Fallout 4} - Use ReShase 4.7.0

Major Note: Copy Depth Buffer Before Clearing needs to be set when you enter the Mech. This also needs to be dissabled when you exit it. Delay Frame don't help here because when
inside the Mech the Depth and BackBuffer are in sync. So best to just switch it in game. I also can't tell if your in the Mech or not.

Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Fallout4. Open Fallout4Prefs.ini and then change the following parameters:

//from
[Imagespace] 
Disable DoF
bDoDepthOfField=1
bScreenSpaceBokeh=1

//to
[Imagespace] 
bDoDepthOfField=0
bScreenSpaceBokeh=0

Fix for Mouse Lag in Fallout 4:
Go to C:\Users\[name]\Documents\My Games\Fallout4\ Fallout4.ini / Fallout4Prefs.ini and steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Fallout4\Fallout4Prefs.ini under [Controls] add:

bMouseAcceleration=0

Warning This next one can make your game unstable. Only do this if you can't handle the mouse lag.
\/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/
Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Fallout4. Open Fallout4Prefs.ini and then change the following parameters:
//from
iPresentInterval=1
//to
iPresentInterval=0
/\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\
Warning This next one can make your game unstable. Only do this if you can't handle the mouse lag.

To be sure, you should also change the iPresentInterval in Fallout4.ini.

Now In games set FOV to something like "fov 90 95" You need to do this each time you start the game or set it in the config file.

A other problem is the Weapon Hand Size it's so big..... I recommend your favorite Lowered Weapons Mod. I use
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20093

{FarCry 2} - ReShade 4.5.2
Use DX9 for weapon in game. Only think I noticed wrong was the guys hair is missing from the DB. 
You have to use DX9 because it draws the weapon correctly so you can have weapon hand depth.

{FarCry 3} - ReShade 4.5.3
Ingame setting MSAA 2X should be on to enable Depth Map in DX11. But, Don't use DX11.
Use DX9 because the depth buffer more stable.

In DX9 you may want to use MXAO and SMAA due to the lower quality AO and Alpha AA.
But, Really use DX9.

{FarCry 5} - ReShade 4.4.2 - Because of EAC
Other things to note you can set FPS Focus Depth if you have issues with aiming with your gun. 
TAA causes shimmering.

{Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition} - ReShade 4.6.1
Problems with getting to the ReShade console.

You can use Ctrl + Tab then tab to the box you want and hit Spacebar. Then use arrow keys to get to the sharder you want and hit enter. Then do this again for the settings.....

You can also run the game in window mode then alt tab with the reshade menu open. Then Click out side then click back in to the game on top of the ReShade menu. Then close it and switch the game back to Fullscreen mode.

{Gold Source: Games} - ReShade 4.5.2
When you install the opengl32.dll right click it and set it to read only.

{Grim Dawn}
For this game I say you should use the FlashBack shader. Since it gives a better sence of Depth for this type of game. You also need to select the right Depth Buffer so that it does
not go blank when you interact with people. This should be under the DX11 Tab in the newest ReShade. 

{GTA 5} - ReShade 4.5.4+
Rename the dxgi.dll too d3d11.dll for DX11 mode or just install it as d3d9.dll.
If the game is crashing in fullscreen. Switch over to Window or Borderless window mode.

So for the mini map go to setting then display.
Radar <Blips> or <Off>
Off if you get the black box in the sky issue.

In this case enable MSAAX2
Set PostFX to normal.

Now the issue of Chromatic Aberration sadly I can't correct for this that easy. You are going to have to download a disable CA removal mod.
Can't see out windows issue. You have to switch the depth buffer to something else. In the DX11 tab

If CA issue really bothers you and you don't want to install any mods you can try the Legacy_Mode in shader set it from 0 to 1

{Half-Life 2} - ReShade 4.5.4 Issues
So In this game The newer reshades seems to have more issues in this game. I hear 4.4.0 "seems" to be better in this game. But, Even with the extra options for source games it drops off in some points.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/305472403977404416/693604937275408524/unknown.png - 4.4.0
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/305472403977404416/693652674427486248/unknown.png - 4.6.0
You can select your own depth buffer or use auto preserve. Some users noted that auto preserve drops out more. But, seems pick the right depth buffer kind of ok.
Make sure to turn off MSAA in game options.

If you can't stand the flickering set this command in console r_3dsky 0
This should stop the flickering at a cost of the backdrop.

I say to just use the latest. You can also use mods like the MMOD with Half-Life 2: Update
But, you still need to use r_3dsky 0

DGVooDoo2 not working nor DXVK.
 
{Hard Reset}
Must Enable FSAA for depth buffer access.

{Hat in Time} - ReShade 4.5.3
I suggest leaving MLAA and dissable DOF and any other blurs and distortions in game settings. It uses DX9 and make sure you set reshade depth buffer to copy. If you don't you will be
stuck with a low resolution depth buffer. 

{Hedon} - ReShade None
This game has build in 3D Options.

GZ Does not draw Sprites in the Depth Buffer So you have to use in game 3D options.
Adjust them in the Options. Then fine tune them with. 

vr_mode "#"
vr_swap false
//following don't to seem to work anymore.
vr_weapon_height 0.0
vr_weapondist 0.6
vr_sprite_scale 0.4 //weapon size
vr_view_yoffset 4.0

Stereo Example & values to try.
For More information look at the mini guide below for GZDOOM.

{Hexen 2} - Hammer of Thyrion & jsHexen II
Open the games Config.cfg file in the data1 folder.
Find gl_ztrick

From gl_ztrick "1"
to   gl_ztrick "0"

The depth buffer should stop flickering in ReShade 4.8.3

Hexen 2 FTEQW 64 should work already.

{HomeFront the Revolution} - Thank you zig11727
Path to Install E:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Homefront_The_Revolution\Bin64
Works Don't know the settings.

{Hitman: Absolution} - Used Reshade 3.0.8
Change the Reflections to Medium. Any higher then this will mess with the Depth Map. Seems like a in game bug.

{Hitman 2016} - Thank you zig11727
Install to \Steam\SteamApps\common\Hitman\Retail
Works Don't know the settings.

{Immortal Redneck} - Used Reshade 4.0.2
If you have depth buffer detection problems you can use the setting below as a starting point.
[DX11_BUFFER_DETECTION]
DepthBufferRetrievalMode=1
DepthBufferTextureFormat=4
ExtendedDepthBufferDetection=0
DepthBufferClearingNumber=2

Please note main menu has a diffrent detection from in game.

{KHOLAT}
Install reshade in to SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KHOLAT\Kholat\Binaries\Win64
In setting scaling 100%

{Kingpin: Life of Crime}
Use GLDirect download it from here.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gldirect/?source=typ_redirect

{Layers of Fear} - Used ReShade 4.3. But You should use an older version of reshade around 3.0 era
If you use modern Reshade then Select DX11 Tab and set the Depth Buffer settings to.
Depth Texture Formant - D24S8
Depth Buffer - to the one with 0 Draw Calls

Helps to look at a lamp or light to get that buffer to stand still. You will know what I mean.

{LEGO Batman 3}
Issues with depth buffer when Black Bars are on screen.
Depth Buffer may not show in main menu.
You need to set your Depth Buffer to preserve in th DX 11 tab.

{Life is Strange} - Used ReShade 4.7.0

Disable DoF and CA

Documents>My Games>Life is Strange>LifeIsStrangeGame>Config

Go to the Life is Strange folder in your documents.
Open the "LifeIsStrangeGame" folder.
Open the "Config" folder.
Open the "LifeIsStrangeEngine.ini" settings file using notepad.

Find the line that reads "bDNEAllowChromaticAberration=True"
and
Find the line that reads "bAllowDNEDOF=True"

Change the "True" to "False" and save.

{Little Nightmares} - Used ReShade 4.3
In setting set Post Processing to low ore Med.

{Lost Planet: Extreme Colonies} - Used ReShade 4.6.1 and DgVoodoo2 for Dx9
Make sure to launch your game and set it up with ReShade dxgi.dll and use DgVoodoo2 to convert DX9 to DX11.
This is done so you have less problems when running this game with ReShade.

{Lost Planet 3} - Used ReShade 4.6.1
May need to alt-tab to get a better depth buffer at native rez. Also make sure you use Copy Depth funtion under the DX9 Tab

{LuciusII}
Set Globla Settings to Medium. Turn off FXAA Every thing else can be maxed out.

{LUST for Darkness} - Used Reshade 4.3
You need to set DX11 Depth Texture Formant to D32FS8.
Also select the first Buffer.

{Mafia II Definitive Edition} - Used Reshade 4.6.1+
A Delay Frame option was added to the shader as work around for the bluring issue casued by the delayed Depth buffer. Expect that one frame of latency.
This should be around 16.6ms at 60fps and 8.325ms at 120fps good thing this game can run really well on modern hardware.

You need to enable "Copy Depth Buffer Before Clear Operation," in side of ReShade to have a working depth buffer.

You Need to Set Near Depth to 0.34 for this game

Halo: CE Anniversary
There is a bug in new versions of ReShade so use 4.4.0 and Check [x] Use aspect ratio heuristics, [x] Copy depth buffers before clear operation, and [x] Copy depth buffers before stencil clear operaton too. 
Then pick the correct buffer in your case.
You Need to set Weapon Profile to the Current Game's Name
You can Clear Near Depth and set it to 0.0.

{MegaMan 2.5D Now in 3D} - ReShade 4.5.0 Xenos_2.3.2 Injector
Install game and make sure in launches in fullscreen and native resolution.

Download https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases and the latest version of reshade.

Create a folder and extract Xenos 2.3.2 you only really need the Xenos.exe 32 bit program and also extract ReShade 32bit dxgi.dll in to the same folder

Click on Select and find the MM25DGame.exe

Now click Inject. Then launch your game like normal.

Keep in mind if you alt-tab or lose this window you will lose depth.

{Metal Gear Rising}
Use a Controller for game play.
Patch the game with MGROverride To get the right resolution for your screen. You can skip this if your max resolution is 1920x1080.
You will also need Borderless Gaming github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases
Start the game and set it to window mode with the resolution and set MSAA to off.
Once that's done. Use the Borderless Gaming app the make it Borderless Full screen.

{Metro Last Light Redux}
Rename the d3d9.dll or dxgi.dll to d3d11.dll

{Metro 2033 Redux}
Rename the d3d9.dll or dxgi.dll to d3d11.dll

{Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor}
3D only works if your game at 100% scaling and FullScreen mode. 
Borderless Full Screen will not work Window mode will not Work. 
So if you want to Play at a lower resolution, then set your windows resolution lower then run the game in full screen and set your scaling to 100%. 
Anything Lower or Higher then 100% will not work.

{Minecraft} - Used Reshade 4.3/4.4 with Network Check disabled. 
Don't Ask my for newtwork check disabled builds of ReShade.

I used Minecraft with Optifine https://optifine.net/downloads
In game go to Options > Video Settings > Shaders  Make sure you select Internal or the shader pack you want. I didn't test anything past Internal.

I recommend you use View Mode Alpha + Performance Mode and Performance Mode in ReShade as well.

{Monster Hunter World}
Main settings for this game need to be set as follows. 
Resolution Scaling "High" to keep the depth buffer from changing on you.
Texture Full seems to reduce blurring.
Use  FXAA or Nothing. TAA Causes too much blurring.
LOD Bias "High" Max Lod Level "NoLimit" Depth Buffer chages cause issues and range checkerboarding problems.

{No One Lives Forever and 2} - Reshade 4.4+
For No One Lives Forever an DX7 game you will need to use DGVoodoo2 for it to work, With ReShade.

For No One Lives Forever 2 an DX8 game you will need to use DGVoodoo2 or DX8toDX9 converter for it to work, With ReShade.

Know Issues. With AMD Cards Main Menu Selections are unreadable in No One Lives Forever 2 with DGVoodoo2, use an Nv Card or the DX8toDX9 Converter.

{RESIDENT EVIL HD BIOHAZARD HD}
The DepthBuffer issues force you to play in 4:3. Because, in 16:9 mode The depth buffer will never match the BackBuffer. Some issues with Clipping by the game is totaly playable.

Should not need to do this. But, you may want to mod this game anyways.
https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_HD_Remaster#Essential_improvements

{RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2 Remake}
Enable RE_Fix in shader "USER EDITABLE PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS."
To do this open up the shader and set RE_Fix to 1.

Should not need to do this anymore. Use Overwatch.fxh

{Resident Evil 7}
Make sure Render Mode is Normal.
Also Scale should be 1 for 1:1.

{Return To Castle Wolfenstine}
Increase Depth to 25+ Do this by typing in your amount.
The game seems to run really slow with my shader at the start. 
This may be a problem with my old card.
But, Wait untill the frame rate stablizes. Then play the game.

Setting you want to change if you want to play at 4k.

Look in your config to see what you need to change. wolfconfig.cfg
Ex.
seta r_customaspect "1"

seta r_customheight "2160"

seta r_customwidth "3840"

seta r_fullscreen "1"

seta r_mode "-1"

If you have nGlide installed.
seta r_glIgnoreWicked3D "1"
or just set your res to 800x600 and set your res in nGlide to your native res. I say use nGlide it looks better and you get to see the in game movies.

{Requiem: Avenging Angel}
Use nglide 1.05 or 1.04 to run this game.

Click on 3DFX.exe Untill it starts..... Some thing wrong with this game. It starts after around 6-10 time I try.

{Serious Sam Fusion} ReShade 4.6.1 - Needs Online Code Dissable for online play. DX12/Vulkan/DX11 all seem to work.
In some maps you need to set Offset back to 0.0 so that you can have proper Depth. You would also need to set it back to 0.1 on other maps. Be mindfull of this.

{Shadow of the TombRaider}
This game has it's own 3D Side by Side mode That renders around half and disabled some effects like AO. This mode has superior convergence/ZPD AKA Pop Out. 
My suggestion is to play in native 3D Side by Side mode. But, Set the game resolution to 25% to 50% more and use MXAO as you AO in game.

If your system can't handle the previous setting. Use Depth Clues and a sharpen with a better form of AA.

A note for HMD Users. You need to limit pop out to the edge of your screen.
You Don't want a mini Lara Croft In your skull do you? 

SLI scaling Is good in this game. Almost full scaling on both cards. If you want to brute force FPS.

{Soldier of Fortune} - ReShade 4.5.2
Download and use the SoF Plus patch. Then Delete QeffectsGL.dll and rename ReShade opengl32.dll to QeffectsGL.dll.

In game max out all the settings and set your resolution you need. Apply settings
Then set Video Driver : Default OpenGL to QeffectsGL (QFX)
Apply settings and you should be good to go.

{S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Games} -  I suggest windows 7 or Windows 10 Anniversary.

Call of Pripyat; 
..\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat\bin\xrEngine.exe 
First Start the Game with out modding and set the settings.
Please install the Complete Mods since I did all my testing with this mod.
Most of the games have problems running in Windows 10 and Long Load times. Run in Compatilbility Mode Windows XP (Service Pack 3) and DPI scaling.

In Windows 10 Anniversary Delete the files in the "prefecth," folder. SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stalker Call of Pripyat\gamedata\configs\prefetch This folder should stay empty. 
It normaly contains prefetch.ltx and or prefetch_single.ltx in the folder. 
You should not need Compatilbility Mode.

Now in Windows 10 Creators update you want to disable Compatilbility Mode.

Clear Sky;
..\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky\bin\xrEngine.exe 
Run in Compatilbility Mode Windows 7 and DPI scaling. First Start the Game with out modding and set the settings. First load should take a long time.
After that it should not take too long any more.

Now in Windows 10 Creators update you want to disable Compatilbility Mode.

Shadow of Chernobyl; - use reshade 3.0.2
..\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl\bin\XR_3DA.exe 
Run in Compatilbility Mode Windows 7 and DPI scaling. First Start the Game with out modding and set the settings.

Now there is one more issue I could not fix was the On screen action button may be hard to read sometimes....... Good luck with that.

{The Forest} - Used ReShade 4.3
Depth Buffer Hides some times Need to look for it in the DX11 Tab. Keep a low Divergence lower then normal in this game.
Also something to note. Depth Buffer is lost sometimes out in open waters. I find that setting Depth Settings as bellow help.

Under DX11 Tab
Depth Texture Formant: D32FS8
Depth Buffer: 0x00000000082ED0FD8 like the 4th one down.

ReShade works when playing this game with friends online. So enjoy.

{The Evil With In}
Game too big for screen DPI scaling. 
To fix this go to where the program is installed and find the EXE

Steam\steamapps\common\TheEvilWithin
Right click the EvilWithin.exe
Go to Compatibility
Check Disable Display Scaling On High DPI Settings

This should fix it. For more look up this problem on google.

I would say also use an FOV fix. Like the one found at http://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/#Download.

{The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild} - Note:  I will not show you how to set up the emulator or the Rom. This part on you. But, If you love the game buy it on console.
First set up the shader as the above settings then.

ReShade it self has issues when you enter a menu to change your weapon/clothes/Stuff. 
To fix this follow this procedure.

Start up CEMU and the enter the game world. Then go back to the CEMU program.
In CEMU to Options. In this Pull-Down Menu click on Separate Gamepad View.
Once this is done go back in to the game and go back to your items Menu.
If going back to your items menu does not give you depth try pressing down on your right stick on your Wii U game Pad or what ever your using to play the game.
The press it again.

This should fix your problem.

If it's stuck with no Depth Try moving it in window mode and resizing it then going back to fullscreen Mode

I also noticed a bug in 1.12.1+ in CEMU that still has not been fixed. DepthBuffer is switching making it unplayable in 3D. 
So if you want to play in 3D use CEMU 1.12.0d It's the latest one I know so far that works.
Do Not Ask me for this version & Yes you should be able to finnish the game with this version of cemu.

You will also need to use a resolution graphics pack form here. https://slashiee.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/ (Older Version 2)

{The Park} - ReShade 4.4.2
This Has Some Depth Buffer issues in cutscenes. Also you need to find a way to disable the depth of field
The good is that, Unreal 4 engine games do indeed have DepthOfField line in SystemSettings section of UDKSystemSettings.ini. That can 
controls mainly depth of field effects. But, may not work you have to test this.

{The Surge} - Thank you zig11727
Install Directory \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Surge\bin

{The Swapper} - ReShade 4.9 as opengl32
So issues with the game with needing the user to select the correct depth buffer in the API Tab. But, also it will be needing alignment and resizing. 
This is done with overwatch.fxh. But, maybe you can do it better. The other issue is with depth in  dark areas of the cave, the dev didn't place a primitive there. 
So this means the dark areas where there should be a wall, instead it will be set to Max depth. It looks like it was an optimization................. 
But, because of this it will cause eye strain.

Use DGVoodoo2 for this game to convert dx9 to dx11.

Settings used in DGVooddoo2 are "Resolution" Set your resolution here and not in game due to a bug that comes up if you set your res in game.
Set MSAA to Off and VRAM to Max 2048MB. Optional you can disable the DGVoodoo Logo if you like.

This is done so you don't have to scale the depth buffer your self.

You can download DGVoodoo2 here http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2.html

Befor you exit switch it back to 1600x1200 Windowed.
 
Note if you want to 4k It's the same process Start the game at 1600x1200 Windowed then switch it to 3840x2160 Fullscreen Windowed.
Also note you can't switch back. 

So say you Start the game at 1600x1200 then switch to 4k then back too 1600x1200 it will not work. If you don't have this resolution.
Create it your self.
You must restart your game for eatch change of resolution.

Update 7.23.2019 When testing with AMD cards the depth buffer seems to not be accessable. I don't know why it's not working.

For geometry stereo open the console and use the commands listed here.
r_stereo_horizontal "1" SbS
r_stereo_vertical "1" TnB
Now after that to adjust the viewmodle use
cl_viewmodel_scale "2" 1-3
For separation of eyes in the world (try negative values too)
r_stereo_separation	"4"

Also please use DarkPlaces "build 20140513" from here. https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/download.html

{Quake Epsilon} - DarkPlaces Quake 1 mod
Install Reshade as OpenGl or use above setting for geometry 3D.

{Dead Space} - retested 10/21/2019
Games Depth Buffer does not show till after the elevator part at the start. Depth Buffer also goes away when interacting with some objects and when you get video feeds.
I suggest useing TriDef. For this game.

{Monstrum}
Start the game in OpenGL or DX3D mode. Game seems to change Depth Buffer now after update. I suggest useing TriDef.

{Portal 2} -Game crashes when loading-
Install to the Bin Folder DX9.
Max out everything. Turn off AA
Open the console.
Type in console;
 
sv_cheats 1
bind 3 "r_drawvgui 1"
bind 2 "r_drawvgui 0"

Once in game press 2 and you should have acess to a Depth Map.
Game Crashes if you leave r_drawvgui 0 when you die. Don't know how to fix this.

{Left 4 Dead 2} -Game Depth Buffer is unstable-

{Shadow warrior(2013)}
 DM 5        2.5-5.0
Depth Buffer only in DX9 so launch it in Shadow Warrior XP and turn on FSAAX2 in game.

{Yume Nikki -Dream Diary-} - ReShade 4.4
ReShade Has a hard time picking the best Depth Buffer......... Sometimes you can't get the best Depth Buffer.

{Zombi} -Depth map Pops in and out-
This Problem seems to happen when looking at one direction. Don't know why it happens. 
But, I suggest useing a othere 3D application like Tridef or Nvidia 3D Vision.

Also Keep in mind if you don't like the depth map I made. You can alawys make your own.

For older versions of reshade.
https://www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository

Here is a quick and dirty game list of working Depth Maps. They are only suggestions. You can use any setting that works for you.
