### **Post-Process shaders for ReShade, Freestyle, & Ansel**
### Highlighted Shaders for ReShade 
**SuperDepth3D & SuperDepth3D VR**<br />
This Shader allows for Depth Map Based 3D like What Nvidia does with Compatibility Mode 3D and what TriDef's does with Power 3D. 
With many more options than regular Depth3D. Depth3D is my shader that helps introduce users to the world of 3D. SuperDepth3D allows much more control and support for different devices.

More in the works at the [AstrayFX](https://blueskydefender.github.io/AstrayFX/) repository. This is shader content that falls outside of Stereo 3D....

### Shader Assistant
**Overwatch.fxh**<br />
Overwatch will assist many of my shaders by setting the Depth Settings for you in select games. To be honest this is the reason donations help me, help you. With every donation this allows Overwatch to grow. This makes it easier to just load it alongside my Depth
Based Shaders and have some settings set for you. Less Hassle more FUN.

### Highlighted Shaders Freestyle & Ansel
**3DViewer**<br />
This Shader allows for Depth Map Based 3D. With more user control to adjust the image too how they want. Compatible with 3DTV's 3DMonitors & VR HMDs. Made with Freestyle & Ansel in mind.

**Enhance**<br /> 
A fast Simple way to enhance the look of your image. Needs to be added.

**Flair**<br />
A multi anamorphic like lens flare shader. It lets you add......... "Flair........" to your images....... get it?
