### **Post-Process shaders for ReShade**
### Highlighted Shaders for ReShade 
**SuperDepth3D**<br />
This shader allows for depth map-based 3D, similar to what NVIDIA offers with Compatibility Mode 3D and what TriDef does with Power 3D. SuperDepth3D provides much more control and support for different devices.

### Shader Assistant
**Overwatch.fxh**<br />
Overwatch is a companion tool designed to enhance your experience with SuperDepth3D by automatically setting depth and 3D configurations in many games. It simplifies setup so you can spend less time tweaking and more time enjoying immersive gameplay.

Honestly, this is where your donations make a real difference. They help me improve and expand Overwatch, making it smarter and compatible with more titles. Less hassle, more fun for everyone.
