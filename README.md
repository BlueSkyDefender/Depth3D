### Shader Assistant
**Overwatch.fxh**<br />
Overwatch will assist many of my shaders by setting the Depth Settings for you in select games. To be honest this is the reason donations help me, help you. With every donation this allows Overwatch to grow. This make it easier to just load it along side my Depth
Based Shaders and have some settings set for you. Less Hassle more FUN.
