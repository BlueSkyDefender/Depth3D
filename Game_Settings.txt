#SuperDepth3D 1.8.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-=BSD Notes=- Personal recommended settings and tips for some games.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Witcher 3*
I noticed when playing this game that a blur setting of 0 is fine as long you can handle Depth setting from 0-30. If you want more
depth but you don't mind sacrificing detail then, override the depth limit and set it from for DM 20 30-40 and set your blur to 0.075-0.100.
That ever looks better too you. DM20 is not as strong as DM14. So the max I think for DM 14 is Depth 30.

*GTA V*
One of the few game where you can override the Depth Limit and run with a higher depth setting. I personaly run mine at 40 and a blur
setting of 0.025

*Deus Ex: Mankind Divided*
I know this game has a built in side by side. But, my head hurs when I use it.
The setting Use for this game for 4k are. Fullscreen not exclisive no Vsync. My preset is custom. Texture Quality Ultra you can set this
lower if you don't have that much GPU memory. Texture Filtering 16x and Shadow Qualty Medium. For AO I set it to ON If you have a good gpu 
set this to Very High. Contact Hard Shadows is set to off. Paralax also set to on. Dof off. Now Level of Detail I have this set too High...
any lower makes the game look bad you may want to set this Very High. Volumetic Lighting set too on. Screenspace Reflections set too on. 
Temporal AA check this off. Motion Blur off. Sharpen I have it on I like it.Cloth Physics I have this set too off because my processor is weak. 
Subsurface Scattering I like the look it has on people. Tessellation on.

*Skyrim: Enhanced Edition*
Seems to work better then the old Skyrim. Less Bugs and runs well on my system. No INI mods needed.

*Wolfenstine: Games*
This game you must read the instructions below so that you are able to get the depth map in game. Also I consider 30 to be max depth in this game.

Here is a quick and dirty game list of working Depth Maps. They are only suggestions. You can use any setting combination you like.

You can also try different depth maps for other games your self by changing AltDepthMap number From 0-26. 
You *may* want to disable AA in game. You can always enable SMAA in reshade for AA or play at 4k with no AA. 
Turn Off DOF in all games if possible. Unless you want to know how it feels to be neer sighted. Turn On SSAO or HABO They help a lot.
Motion Blur Off

Also Keep in mind if you don't like the depth map I made. You can alawys make your own.

Then head to the folder and rename d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. 
Now open the DPfix095.zip Directly from http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DPfix095.zip or http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438.

Install the contents of that folder in to Deadly Premonition Folder where you changed Reshade's d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. Edit the DPfix.ini too what ever REZ you want. Then start the game.

{Dungeon Nightmares II}
Highest Setting is "Good" Any thing Lower will work and thing above will not work. Make sure to set your res to native.

3D only works if your game at 100% scaling and FullScreen mode. 
Borderless Full Screen will not work Window mode will not Work. 
So if you want to Play at a lower resolution, then set your windows resolution lower then run the game in full screen and set your scaling to 100%. 
Anything Lower or Higher then 100% will not work.

Start the game in DX11 mode.

{Phantasmal}
A buggy Opengl game. But, hold down ctrl when starting the game and set your resolution. That or use "-show-screen-selector" in launch options. Once in game Start it. Then you will get a overblown screen. From here press Alt+Enter. Then hit escape and set your resoution and settings to ultra dissable motion blur. Set your settings and now press shift+f2 for reshade and set your settings for Depth3D.

{Penumbra: Black Plague}
Go here
C:\Users\...\Documents\Penumbra\settings.cfg
Open the settings and set your res. 
<Screen Width="3840" Height="2160" FullScreen="true" Vsync="true" />

{Portal 2}
Max out everything. Turn off AA
Open the console.
Type in console;
 
sv_cheats 1
bind 3 "r_drawvgui 1"
bind 2 "r_drawvgui 0"

Once in game press 2 and you should have acess to a Depth Map.

{Quake 4}
If some how you can click on the menu......... Good Luck.
Also if some how you get it working When the game Saves You have to recheck the 3D shader. 
This is where a Defaults.ini will come in handy.

{Rage}
Start the game with out Reshade Set your game resolution First Turn off AA. 
Exit, Then use reshade and set your setting you want then launch your game. You can not change your resolution once in game This sill remove the depth map.
Rage 64 was tested only.

{Return To Castle Wolfenstine}
Increase Depth to 25+ Do this by typing in your amount.
The game seems to run really slow with my shader at the start. 
This may be a problem with my old card.
But, Wait untill the frame rate stablizes. Then play the game.

Setting you want to change if you want to play at 4k.

Look in your config to see what you need to change. wolfconfig.cfg
Ex.
seta r_customaspect "1"

seta r_customheight "2160"

seta r_customwidth "3840"

seta r_fullscreen "1"

seta r_mode "-1"

{Skyrim V}
Antialiasing Must be set too 2 Samples or more in the Options.
Open your SkyrimPrefs.ini. Usually it should be found under %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Skyrim
Edit the indicated sections of the INI like so:

[Terrainmanager]
fBlockMaximumDistance=500000
fBlockLevel1Distance=140000
fBlockLevel0Distance=75000
fSplitDistanceMult=4.0

[MAIN]
fSkyCellRefFadeDistance=600000.0000

[Display]
bFloatPointRenderTarget=0
bDeferredShadows=0

{Shadow warrior(2013)}
Depth Buffer only in DX9 so launch it in Shadow Warrior XP and turn on FSAAX2 in game.


{Stay Close}
Install reshade in too Steam\steamapps\common\Stay Close\Migrate\Binaries\Win64

{S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Games}
Please install the Complete Mods since I did all my testing with this mod.
I most of the games have problems running in Windows 10 and Long Load times.
Shadow of Chernobyl Had a depth map that fluctuates for some reason.

{The Evil With In}
Game too big for screen DPI scaling. 
To fix this go to where the program is installed and find the EXE

Steam\steamapps\common\TheEvilWithin
Right click the EvilWithin.exe
Go to Compatibility
Check Disable Display Scaling On High DPI Settings

This should fix it. For more look up this problem on google.

{The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux}

Instal Dll too D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux\EthanCarter\Binaries\Win64

{Through The Woods}
In game Set your Res to Native screen Res.

{Wolfenstine: Games} - working in Reshade 3.0 and Rehade 2.0
[Set Launch Options](+r_multisamples "0" +vt_maxaniso "16")
This game must be started at the lower Resoution 1600x1200 Then Switch to 1920x1080. Befor you exit switch it back to 1600x1200. 
Note if you want to 4k It's the same process Start the game at 1600x1200 then switch it to 3840x2160.
Also note you can't switch back. So say you Start the game at 1600x1200 then switch to 4k then back too 1600x1200 it will not work. 
If you change it one last time to 4k It will not work. You must restart your game for eatch change of resolution.
You can always enable SMAA in reshade for AA or play at 4k with no AA.

In order to completely disable DOF:

“open up graphicsprofiles.json and find the postprocessdof line and change high and ultra to 0.” \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Wolfenstein.The.New.Order\base\graphicsprofiles.json

Should look like this;
Ex.
"r_postProcessDofMode" : 
	{ 
		"low" : 0,
		"mid" : 0,
		"high" : 0,
		"ultra" : 0
	},
